    <h1> Hello there!</h1>
    <p>My name is Okuru Mercy Ubughenaan and I like to describe myself as an aspiring software engineer ðŸ˜Ž. I picked up
        front-end web development as a hobby at first but it's slowly becoming a lifestyle ðŸ˜‚. <br> In my free time, I
        love to daydream about the wonderful crafts I would have made if the resources were at my beck and call...
        Why do I feel like that would come off as weird??? You know what...ignore that. When I'm not coding, I'm
        probably roaming thhe streets of pinterest learning new stuff and hoarding the cutest pics or creating ideas in
        my head.ðŸ¥°
        On this page, I hope you can see my skill set (everything vanilla) while getting an idea of my kind of person.
    </p>
